     is a standard markup language for documents design to be displayed in a browser.It is defines meaning and structure of web content.HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure webpages. It uses a system of tags and elements to define different parts of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and tables. HTML is not a programming language but a markup language that provides the basic framework of a website, which is then enhanced by CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. Every webpage you see on the internet is built using HTML, making it the foundation of web development.</blockquote></p>

    <b style="background-color: yellow;"><i>Cascading Style Sheets(css)</i></b> is used to style and design web pages. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and spacing of HTML elements. With <b>CSS</b>, we can make web pages look attractive and responsive on all devices.CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is the language used to design and control the appearance of webpages. It defines how elements should look — including colors, fonts, spacing, backgrounds, and overall layout. CSS makes websites attractive and easy to navigate by separating design from content. It allows developers to create consistent styles across multiple pages and supports responsive design so websites look good on all devices, from mobiles to desktops. The “cascading” part of CSS means that styles are applied in order of priority, giving flexibility and control over how elements appear. Modern CSS also includes advanced features like animations, transitions, flexbox, and grid systems that help create visually appealing, dynamic, and well-structured websites.JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive and dynamic. It allows websites to respond to user actions like clicking buttons, filling forms, or showing messages without reloading the page. Unlike HTML and CSS, which handle structure and design, JavaScript controls the behavior of a webpage. It can change content, update styles, validate user input, and even communicate with servers. JavaScript runs directly in the browser, making it essential for creating modern, responsive, and user-friendly websites. It’s also used beyond web pages — in mobile apps, games, and server-side development using technologies like Node.js.</blockquote></p>
